# BTL200-MAth-for-developers
This course is Garbage espescially if you have the wqrong teacher. I got Samer Hijazi or whatever crap his name is. Most likely soe Iranian Shit this guy teaches at Centnenial college for MATH128 or 168 and at Seneca for BTL200. I dont know what the hell the people wer ethinking hiring this guy as this guy doesnt teach properly or reply to emails for clarifications on the details of assignment. He only tells you to read the instruction. Any how I hope I can make your liffe easier by providing you eith assignments. Best of luck and try to transfer out to another section This is for section NAA
